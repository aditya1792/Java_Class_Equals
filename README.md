# Java_Class_Equals
/* Proper way to write a class in Java. Whenever anyone asks a person to write a java class, the person might just wite a java class like "class ABC { }" for example; but one has to focus on many more parameters other than this so that the class qualifies for industry. Let us make a class employee to get into the details.*//* In conclusion we saw two classes here, the first one being an ibuilt Java class, "String", we could dirctly use equals method to check whether the content inside is same. Remember the equals method is needed because if we check the content inside the objects of class with "==" operator, then even if our content is same then to we will get not equal or false because it checks the reference. It has been observed that equals method works easily and quite effectively with classes inbuilt in Java like the string class. But in case of classes built by users, the equals method doesn't work directly, it has to be overridden. There are certain cnditions for equality approval like even the hashcodes must be same. So everything along with proper template for class has been explained in the given code above.*/
